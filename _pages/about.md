Hi! I'm **Fuming (Felix) Yang**, a Research Fellow in the [Lichtman Lab](https://lichtmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University.

## Research Interests

My research interests center on using **AI/ML methods to build high-throughput imaging pipelines** and on understanding how to extract **biological insights from large brain datasets**, while letting those insights, in turn, **inform advances in AI/ML**.

## Current Work

I'm currently leading data-acquisition efforts at an electron microscopy facility at Harvard as part of **High-throughput Integrative Mouse Connectomics (HI-MC)** project, a collaboration across **Harvard, Princeton, Google, MIT, the Allen Institute, Cambridge University, and Johns Hopkins University**. We're aiming to reconstruct **10 mm³** of adult mouse cortex at nanometer resolution (~20PB). I build, operate and optimize the imaging pipeline, develop high-throughput quality-control workflows, and perform downstream analysis. The pipeline combines a custom tissue mill with a **91-beam** scanning electron microscope (Zeiss MultiSEM) for automated, record-speed imaging of large neural volumes.



## Research Areas

- **Computer Vision & ML**: Graph theory, image compression, 2D/3D reconstruction, NN architecture
- **Neuroscience**: Connectomics, developmental neuroscience, synapses elimination
- **Software & Tools**: High-throughput imaging pipelines, automated acqusition/QC workflows
